libpeak -- network-related library glue
=======================================

This library consists of several modules and generic base headers
designed around the daily needs of network packet-related userland
tools written in C.  Currently, the available modules are:

peak_li:	lightweight inspection (DPI)
peak_load:	PCAP/ERF file reader
peak_tcp:	shallow TCP engine
peak_track:	rudimentary flow tracker
peak_udp:	shallow UDP engine

There's also a bunch of arch-independent base headers, which offer
simple memory pools, runtime allocation wrappers, network address
mapping, some hashes, output macros, spinlock/barrier wrappers,
and so forth.

A good introduction to the code would be its man pages.  The first of
them being peek(1).

ISC license (see COPYING for details).  Its main contributors are:
