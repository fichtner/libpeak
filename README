libpeak -- network-related library glue
=======================================

This library consists of several modules and generic base headers
designed around the daily needs of network packet-related userland
tools written in C.  Currently, the available modules are:

peak_li:	lightweight inspection (DPI)
peak_load:	PCAP/PCAPNG/ERF/NETMON file reader
peak_netmap:	simplified netmap(4) bindings
peak_tcp:	shallow TCP engine
peak_track:	rudimentary flow tracker
peak_udp:	shallow UDP engine

There's also a bunch of arch-independent base headers, which offer
simple memory pools, runtime allocation wrappers, network address
mapping, some hashes, output macros, spinlock/barrier wrappers,
and so forth.

A good introduction to the code would be its man pages.  The first of
them being peek(1).

Licensing and contributions
===========================

The library has been developed by Packetwerk and is released under the
ISC license (see COPYING for details).  Its main contributors are:

Franco Fichtner <franco@packetwerk.com>
Victor Pereira <victor@packetwerk.com>

Feel free to fork or contribute back.  To do so, use GitHub or send
your patches to us via email.  Contributions can also be made in the
form of supplying trace files or hard to come by documentation to help
maintain a reliable and free library.

Basic directory layout
======================

bin/		project binaries
contrib/	third-party code
include/	base headers
lib/		specific modules
regress/	test framework
sample/		trace files
scripts/	auxiliary stuff
test/		test binaries

Building and running the code
=============================

Either make(1) or scons(1) can be used as the build tool.  The code
builds fine on MacOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD and Linux
(Ubuntu with pmake installed).  You break it, you fix it.

Building the code:

    make
    scons

Running the tests:

    cd regress && make
    cd regress && scons

Having fun:

    priceless ;)
